## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed the title from "Provide Functions for Simulating the Development of h-Index Values" to "Simulating the Development of h-Index Values"

* Added a reference describing the methods used in the package to the Description in the DESCRIPTION file. 

## Test environments
* Local ubuntu 18.04, R 3.4.4
* Winbuilder (devel and release)
* R-hub

## R CMD check --as-cran results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE: 

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
  Maintainer: ‘Alexander Tekles <alexander.tekles@soziologie.uni-muenchen.de>’

  New submission
  
  Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    Bornmann (19:18)
    al (19:30)
    bibliometric (15:40)
    et (19:27)
    
This is the first submission of the package. 'bibliometric' has been double-checked to be spelled correctly. 'Bornmann', 'et', and 'al' are part of a reference in the DESCRIPTION file.

## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
