Description: H-index and h-alpha are a bibliometric indicators. This package 
  provides functions to simulate how these indicators may develop over time for
  a given set of researchers and to visualize the simulation data. 
  The implementation is based on the 'STATA' ado h-index and is described in 
  more detail in Bornmann et al. (2019) <arXiv:1905.11052>.
